+.BR Description: " If set to a positive integer, this value specifies a HTTP session lifetime
+in seconds. After initial authentication using standard HTTP mechanisms (HTTP Basic or Negotiate
+authentication), the server generates a cookie and sends it back to the client, as described in
+RFC 6265. The client can then use the cookie in subsequent requests to skip the usual HTTP
+authentication. The cookie is valid only for period of time specified by this configuration option.
+If set to zero, session management is turned off and CIM server will not issue cookies.
+This option is available only when Pegasus was compiled with PEGASUS_ENABLE_SESSION_COOKIES set
+to 'true'.
